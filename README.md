# Faculty Recommendation System
This project is a machine learning-based recommendation system designed to assist students in identifying suitable faculties based on their BAC results (is the final high school graduation exam in Romania). The system utilizes a structured database, predictive algorithms, and a user-friendly web interface to provide personalized recommendations.

## Data Sources
The initial datasets used in this project were obtained from the following sources:

- **BAC Results**: Provided by [Ministerul Educatiei si Cercetarii](https://data.gov.ro/dataset?tags=bacalaureat)
- **Faculties Data**: Collected from [ROSE: Romanian Secondary Education Project](https://www.rose-edu.ro/lista-universitati/)
- **Address Data**: Extracted from [Ministerul Educatiei si Cercetarii](https://www.edu.ro/sites/default/files/Lista_unitati_invatamant_raspuns_invitatie_participare_PNRAS_0.pdf).

These datasets were processed and cleaned to generate the final datasets used for the recommendation system. See the `data_cleaning.py` script for details.
